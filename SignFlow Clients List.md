## Lookup Quick Reference
When looking up a client's info for appropriate labeling, go through the table to find the piece of info in the message to match it to the company name and then correct github label

## Adding New Clients

When adding new clients, include:
1. **Company Name** (for GitHub labels)
2. **Owner/Contact Name** (for informal references)
3. **Location** (city/state for geographic references)
4. **Specialization** (if applicable)
5. **GitHub Label** (create matching label in repository)

## Notes
- This list should be updated whenever new clients are added
- GitHub labels should match the company names
- Use this reference when client identification is unclear from context
- Owner names, locations, etc provide alternative lookup methods
