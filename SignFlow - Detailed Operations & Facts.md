## Operational Details

### Cost Per Click Targets
- **Optimal Range**: $2.00 - $3.00 CPC
- **Below $1.90**: Usually low-quality traffic

- **Target**: ~$2.50 CPC for sustainable lead generation

### Campaign Strategy
- **Primary**: Google Search ads
- **Secondary**: Performance Max (without video assets)
  - Uses only picture and text assets
  - Shows on Google Maps, Search, Gmail
  - Avoids low-intent YouTube traffic

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Platform**: GoHighLevel (GHL) for automations, pipelines, landing pages
- **Custom Templates**: Built for signage industry, requires subdomain setup
- **Phone Systems**: Call forwarding, A2P verification requirements
- **DNS Management**: Help clients set up subdomains for hosted landing pages

## Pricing Structure Details

### Three-Tier Pricing Model

**Tier 1: Small Companies**
- **Retainer**: $1,100/month
- **Ad Spend**: $900/month
- **Total**: $2,000/month
- **Target**: One-man shows or very small operations

**Tier 2: Standard Package**
- **Retainer**: $1,500/month
- **Ad Spend**: $1,200-1,500/month

- **No Contracts**: Month-to-month basis, no binding agreements

## Sales & Marketing Process

### Internal Lead Generation
- **Channel**: Facebook/Instagram ads
- **Hook**: "12 signed projects next month or you don't pay" guarantee
- **Process**: Lead form → appointment setter calls within 2 minutes → books calendar

### Sales Call Process
- Conducted by sales-focused founder
- Deep industry knowledge and experience
- Often clients forget about guarantee during discussion
- Payment collection on first call preferred
- If no payment: separate onboarding call for payment + technical setup

### Guarantee Mechanism
- **Formula**: Total Ad Spend ÷ $250 = Guaranteed Signed Projects
- **Example**: $3,000 ad spend = 12 projects guaranteed
- **Fulfillment**: If target missed, next month is free (no refund, continue service)
- **Psychology**: Many clients attracted by guarantee but forget during sales process
