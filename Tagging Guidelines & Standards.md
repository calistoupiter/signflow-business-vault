# Tagging Guidelines & Standards

## Philosophy

Tags in this vault serve as **broad thematic categorization** rather than granular content descriptors. The goal is to maintain a curated, high-level taxonomy that provides meaningful organization without overwhelming specificity.

## Core Principles

### 1. Broad Over Granular
- Use **high-level thematic tags** (e.g., `#religion`, `#math`, `#physics`)
- Avoid **specific subtopic tags** (e.g., `#quantum-mechanics`, `#christianity`, `#calculus`)
- Think "what major domain does this belong to?" not "what specific aspect does this cover?"

### 2. Quality Over Quantity
- Only tag when the tag is **100% applicable** to the note's core content
- Better to have no tag than a marginally relevant tag
- Each note should typically have 1-3 tags maximum

### 3. Approved Tags Only
- Use only tags from the **Approved Tags List** below
- If you need a new tag, follow the **Tag Proposal Process**
- Never create ad-hoc tags without approval

## Tag Application Rules

### When to Tag:
- ✅ The tag represents a **major theme** of the note
- ✅ The note would be **meaningfully discoverable** under this tag
- ✅ You would **expect to find** this note when browsing that tag

### When NOT to Tag:
- ❌ The topic is mentioned but not central to the note
- ❌ The tag is only relevant to one paragraph or section
- ❌ You're unsure if the tag fits
- ❌ The tag doesn't exist in the approved list

## Approved Tags List

### Core Knowledge Domains
- `#biology`
- `#chemistry` 
- `#physics`
- `#math`
- `#psychology`
- `#philosophy`
- `#economics`
- `#linguistics`

### Applied Domains
- `#business`
- `#health`
- `#nutrition`
- `#fitness`
- `#technology`

### Personal & Social
- `#family`
- `#relationships`
- `#personal-development`

### Abstract & Meta
- `#religion`
- `#politics`
- `#methodology`
- `#planning`

### Process Tags (Special Use)
- `#brainstorming` (for miscellaneous idea collections)
- `#analysis` (for comparative/analytical content)
- `#reference` (for lookup/reference materials)

## Tag Proposal Process

When you encounter content that needs a tag not on the approved list:

### Step 1: Evaluation
Ask yourself:
- Is this truly a **broad thematic area** that will recur in my vault?
- Would this tag be useful for **multiple future notes**?
- Does it represent a **fundamental domain** rather than a subset of existing tags?

### Step 2: Proposal Format
Create a proposal with:
```
**Proposed Tag:** #[tag-name]
**Rationale:** Why this tag is needed
**Scope:** What types of notes would use this tag
**Alternative:** Could existing tags work instead?
**Examples:** 2-3 notes that would use this tag
```

### Step 3: Decision
- **Accept:** Add to approved list and apply to relevant notes
- **Reject:** Leave notes untagged or use closest existing tag

## Tag Maintenance

### Regular Review
- Quarterly review of tag usage and relevance
- Remove unused tags from approved list
- Consolidate overly similar tags

### Consistency Checks
- Ensure all tags follow naming conventions (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
- Verify tags are being applied consistently across similar content
- Check for tag drift (tags being used outside their intended scope)

## Examples

### ✅ Good Tagging
- **Note:** "Darwin Evolution Theory.md" → `#biology`
- **Note:** "Political Views & Libertarianism.md" → `#politics`, `#philosophy`
- **Note:** "Nutrition.md" → `#health`, `#nutrition`

### ❌ Poor Tagging
- **Note:** mentioning exercise routine → `#fitness` (if note is primarily about something else)
- **Note:** brief reference to psychology → `#psychology` (if psychology isn't the main topic)
- **Note:** creating `#evolutionary-biology` instead of using `#biology`

## Benefits of This System

1. **Prevents Tag Proliferation** - Maintains manageable number of meaningful tags
2. **Ensures Semantic Coherence** - Tags actually represent distinct knowledge domains
3. **Improves Discoverability** - High-level tags make content easier to find
4. **Maintains Quality** - Strict application criteria prevent tag pollution
5. **Allows Controlled Growth** - Tag proposal system enables thoughtful expansion
